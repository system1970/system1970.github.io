## Navigation

Each project is contained within its own directory. You can navigate to the respective folders to find the project files, and in many cases, a dedicated `README.md` with more specific information about that project (or one will be added).

Most web-based projects can be run by opening the main HTML file (e.g., `index.html`, `main.html`) in a web browser. Python-based projects will typically have a `main.py` or similar entry point and may require specific dependencies to be installed. Please refer to individual project directories for more detailed instructions if available.
