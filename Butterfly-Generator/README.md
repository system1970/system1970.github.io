# Lorenz Attractor Visualization (Butterfly Generator)

This project is a visually captivating and interactive representation of the Lorenz Attractor, often known as the "butterfly effect," implemented using **Vue.js**.

## Description

The Lorenz Attractor is a system of ordinary differential equations first studied by Edward Lorenz. It is notable for having chaotic solutions for certain parameter values and initial conditions. The visualization demonstrates how a deterministic system can exhibit chaotic behavior.

This project highlights data visualization skills, front-end development expertise with Vue.js, and the ability to translate complex mathematical concepts into engaging web experiences.

## How to View

1.  Clone this repository or download the files in the `Butterfly-Generator` directory.
2.  Open the `index.html` file in a modern web browser.
3.  The visualization should load and display the Lorenz Attractor animation.

## Files

*   `index.html`: The main HTML file to launch the visualization.
*   `script.js`: Contains the JavaScript logic for the visualization, including the Vue.js implementation and Lorenz Attractor calculations.
*   `style.css`: Contains the styling for the HTML elements.
*   `preview.png`: A preview image of the visualization.
