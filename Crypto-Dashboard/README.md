# Real-time Crypto Price Dashboard

This project is a live cryptocurrency price dashboard that visualizes real-time price fluctuations for Bitcoin (BTC).

## Description

The dashboard fetches data from the **CoinGecko API** and uses **Chart.js** for interactive charting. It demonstrates data fetching from external APIs, real-time data updates, and dynamic data visualization techniques in a web application.

The `index.html` file references a `canvas` element with `id="cryptoChart"`, which is where the Chart.js graph is rendered. The `script.js` file contains the logic for fetching data from the CoinGecko API and updating the chart.

## How to View

1.  Clone this repository or download the files in the `Crypto-Dashboard` directory.
2.  Open the `index.html` file in a modern web browser.
3.  The dashboard should load and display a real-time price chart for Bitcoin. An internet connection is required to fetch data from the CoinGecko API.
