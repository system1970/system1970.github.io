# Code Translate with ChatGPT

This project is an experimental code translation tool that leverages the **ChatGPT API** to translate code snippets from one programming language to another.

## Description

The tool provides a web interface where users can input their code, select the source and target languages, and receive the translated code generated by ChatGPT. It demonstrates a practical application of AI for software development workflows, exploring natural language processing and AI-assisted problem-solving in a coding context.

**Note:** As this tool uses the ChatGPT API, it requires a valid API key and proper setup for the API calls to function correctly. The `gpt.js` file likely handles the API interaction.

## How to Use

1.  Clone this repository or download the files in the `Code Translate` directory.
2.  Open the `code.html` file in a modern web browser.
3.  Input your code snippet, select the source and target languages.
4.  Ensure you have configured the `gpt.js` file with your ChatGPT API key or handle API key input as required by the script.
5.  Initiate the translation.

## Files

*   `code.html`: The main HTML file for the user interface of the translation tool.
*   `gpt.js`: Contains the JavaScript logic for interacting with the ChatGPT API. **API key configuration is likely needed here.**
*   `test.html`: Potentially a test page or an alternative interface.
*   `images/pixelCity.png`: An image asset, possibly used in the UI.
*   `p1.png`: A preview image of the project.
